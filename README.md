1.2 Arithmetic Operations:

The code performs basic arithmetic operations on the input numbers.
Input:
The user is prompted to enter two integer numbers (num1 and num2).

Addition: add = num1 + num2
Subtraction: sub = num1 - num2
Multiplication: mul = num1 * num2
Division: div = num1 / num2
The results of these operations are stored in variables.

Output:
The code prints the results of the arithmetic operations.

Example:
Input:
5
3

Output:
addition: 8
subtraction: 2
multiplication: 15
division: 1.6666666666666667

2. String Replace/Modification:
   
Input:
The user is prompted to enter a string (s2).

The code splits the input string into a list of words using the split method with the space character as the delimiter.
For each word in the list, if the word is "python", it is replaced with "pythons". Otherwise, the word is appended to the new string (s1).
The modified string is then printed.

Output:

The modified string with "python" replaced by "pythons" is printed.
Example:

Input: 
I love playing with python
Output: 
I love playing with pythons
